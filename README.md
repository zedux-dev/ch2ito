## The problem
**Heavy metals** have a **carcinogenic** nature and even though around 74% of the world population has access to safely managed drinking water none of us is safe from **water pollution**. Because heavy metals ions can enter and climb the food chain reaching our tables.

## Our solution
Our Chito is an innovative and hi-tech buoy, it can be anchored to the shore, to the seabed or attached to boats at the sea or in rivers and lake. It has two main functions

 - **Water filtration:** Our buoy uses chitosan to absorbs polluting substances such as lead, mercury and cadmium some of the worst heavy metals pollutants.
 - **Data collection:** Our buoy uses chitosan to absorbs polluting substances such as lead, mercury and cadmium some of the worst heavy metals pollutants.
 - **Circular economy:** Our buoy uses chitosan to absorbs polluting substances such as lead, mercury and cadmium some of the worst heavy metals pollutants.
